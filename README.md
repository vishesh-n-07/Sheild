# SHEILD — Smart Human Emergency Instant Location Device

**SHEILD** is a prototype emergency-alert system (app + embedded device integration) that lets users instantly send location + voice/image evidence to pre-configured contacts and emergency services when triggered.  
We aim to eventually turn the solution into a wearable (watch) for instant single-button alerts and automatic evidence capture.

## Key features
- Immediate alert with GPS location (SMS / app push).  
- Automatic short audio recording and image capture on trigger.  
- Evidence stored and uploaded to secure backend (for later review).  
- Priority-level alerts (Fire / Weapon / Harassment / Medical).  
- Prototype: Android app + GSM/GPS embedded module; Future: watch integration.
